# Local Library
This is a remake of the [MDN Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website) built in a microservice fashion with some of the best technologies I am familiar with. It started out as an assessment for a backend job application that I didn't submit but I decided to take it to the next level and making it a place for me to play around with languages I know and tools I have learnt. It's the world's most cutting-edge library and features a lot of features you won't see in your local library.
