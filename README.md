# Local Library
This is a remake of the [MDN Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website) built in a microservice fashion with some of the best technologies I am familiar with. It's the world's most cutting-edge library and features a lot of features you won't see in your local library.

## Setting up Locally
[See the dev README](dev/README.md)
